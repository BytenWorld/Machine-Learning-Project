# Machine-Learning-Project
Machine learning classifier developed to classify cancer based on methylation patterns. Methylation patterns were derived from cfDNA WGS data using the program FinaleMe available at: https://github.com/epifluidlab/FinaleMe

Jupyter notebooks include feature selection process carried out using MethylKit in R, machine learning project in Python, genome annotation using Annotatr in R and the analysis of the annaotation in python.

Zip file contains jupyter notebooks:
-Identification of dmCpGs using methylKit
-Machine learning models for classifying models
-Annotation of CpG using annotatr
-Analysis of CpGs from annotatr

Zip files also contain data such as list of dmCpGs from samples and annotations generated by annotatr.
